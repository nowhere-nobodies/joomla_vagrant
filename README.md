Nowhere Development Vagrant Box
===============================

This vagrant box is used for creating a development environment for the
current goingnowhere.org Joomla installation.

There are no site files or databases kept in this repository.
Therefore, this vagrant box will not do much, other than create a virtual machine.

To use this vagrant box correctly,
you will need to get the necessary files from the Nowhere Web Team.

Once you have the missing database and files, you can follow these instruction
to get the development environment working.
